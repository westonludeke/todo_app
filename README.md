# 239 Project

### Notes

* The Javascript code is in-line inside of the HTML document. I had originally moved all of the JS code to a separate `script.js` file after finishing the project, but that was causing errors and I ran out of time to debug the issues.

* I decided to hide the `Mark As Complete` button on the new todo modal and only display it on the modal to edit an existing todo.

* I also added a new button `Mark As Incomplete` which will display on the edit todo modal instead of the `Mark As Complete` button if the todo is already been completed. In case the user would like to change the todo's status from completed back to incomplete.
