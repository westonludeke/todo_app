# 239 Project

### Notes

* I decided to hide the `Mark As Complete` button on the new todo modal and only display it on the modal to edit an existing todo.

* I also added a new button `Mark As Incomplete` which will display on the edit todo modal instead of the `Mark As Complete` button if the todo is already been completed. In case the user would like to change the todo's status from completed back to incomplete.
